            These pieces are created by Kunstig, an AI that has taught itself to paint on its own. Kunstig is heavily
            inspired by Edward Munch but you can also see that he takes from the abstract world of art as well. Kunstig
            can produce an infinite amount of unique artworks, meaning there will never exist two identical pieces.
